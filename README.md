# imageMover
Python code to move all images at one from one folder to another. 
Here are the instructions on how to use the Python script to move images from your download folder to the designated folder:

#Download the Script:

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Download the Python script provided in the previous response and save it to a location on your computer.
Edit Paths:

#Open the downloaded script in a text editor (like Notepad on Windows).
Replace the placeholders in the script:
Replace C:\Users\user\Downloads with the actual path to your download folder.
Replace the C:\Users\user\Downloads\images test with the actual path to your designated folder.
Run the Script:

#Open a command prompt or terminal window on your computer.
Navigate to the folder where you saved the script using the cd command (e.g., cd path\to\script\folder).
Run the script by entering python script_name.py, where script_name.py is the name of the script file.
See the Results:

#The script will start working and move image files from the download folder to the designated folder.
You'll see messages in the command prompt indicating which files are being moved and any errors encountered.
Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform file operations in both the download folder and the designated folder. Also, be cautious when running scripts from untrusted sources, and always review the code to understand what it's doing before running it.
